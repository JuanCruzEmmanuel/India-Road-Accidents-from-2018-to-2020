# JuanCruzEmmanuel-India-Road-Accidents-from-2018-to-2020
Using the kaggle dataset zsinghrahulk/road-accidents-india-2017-2020, analyze the accidents that occurred in India between 2018 and 2020.
First, what I did was eliminate rows that are not useful to me and create columns with information that I saw as necessary for the analysis.

# Total accidents
